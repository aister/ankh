> YAMDBF-based WIP Discord Bot in TypeScript

### About
> This bot is entirely in-dev from the ground up. Expect shit not to work or not to exist yet. Since I work a full-time job as well, features are tended to be added when I have time or when I feel like it. You can contribute to it if you want.

### Contributing
1. Fork.
2. Create a feature branch (i.e. `git checkout -b <feature>`)
3. Commit.
4. Submit PR.

Eh.
